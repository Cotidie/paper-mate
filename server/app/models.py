"""Pydantic v2 models — single source of the API contract (AD-3, AD-5).

Pydantic models here feed FastAPI's OpenAPI schema, which is generated into TS
types for the client via ``openapi-typescript``. Client API types are generated,
never hand-authored.

The ``Annotation`` entity (AD-5) is defined here (Epic 2, Story 2.2). Its
GET/PUT ``/annotations`` endpoints are Epic 3 — so the model is surfaced into
OpenAPI by an injection in ``app.main`` (no endpoint references yet), and the
